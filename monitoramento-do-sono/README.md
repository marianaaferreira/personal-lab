**Business Intelligence Project: Sleep Monitoring**

The goal of this project is to better understand my sleep patterns based on real data I capture daily using data collected through a smartwatch. The data is exported to an Excel spreadsheet and loaded into Power BI, where it is analyzed across various dimensions such as sleep stages, duration, interruptions, and overall quality.
